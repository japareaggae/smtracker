smtracker - StepMania Score Tracker
=====

smtracker is a simple [StepMania][sm] score tracker written in Python.
It works by parsing a Stats.xml file (either from your local profile,
the machine profile or from a user specified file) and displaying
(either in a Qt interface or in a HTML report) a table with your best
results in each song.

Requirements
-----

* Python 3 (tested on 3.5 and 3.4)
* PyQt5
* Jinja2

Installing on Windows
-----

On Windows, you will need to install PyQt5 manually in order to use
smtracker. You can install PyQt5 for Windows from [Riverbank's website][pyqt5].
It was built against Python 3.4, so make sure to download that version
of Python and not 3.5. You can download Python 3.4 from [Python's website][pywin].

Known Issues
-----

* The Stats.xml file does not know any information about a song, except
where it's located. This means some songs (especially songs with
Japanese titles) will not appear with the same title as in game.
